# General Inquirer Asset Generation

These scripts convert the available Excel document of GI categories into json objects, which are then converted into rules formatted for a spaCy Matcher object.

## Progress

Overall progress is displayed in [category_statistics_table.md](category_statistics_table.md) in this folder, and is generated by `category_table.py`.

### What is involved in porting?

The import script as it stands handles easy cases first: for most terms in the General Inquirer, we can match a term and POS tag to generate a matcher rule directly from the excel file. These are about 90% of the rules. The other 10 percent are multi-term idioms or more complex phrases where rules will likely have to be written manually.
